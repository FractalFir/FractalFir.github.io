<p>In this article, I am going to first describe a rough, draft version(0.0.0) of the interop framework - <code>mycorrhiza</code>. After that, I plan on getting into how interop works under the hood, showing some examples which do not use the abstraction layer, and use raw compiler intrinsics. This will enable me to explain how exactly the backend handles concepts not present in Rust - such as virtual methods, and GC managed objects.</p>

<h1 id='mycorrhiza'>mycorrhiza</h1>

<p><code>mycorrhiza</code> is a crate (Rust library) facilitating easy Rust/.NET interop. My goal is to build an abstraction layer, which hides the fact that the code is running inside the .NET runtime. I want code using mycorrhiza to look as much as &quot;standard&quot; Rust code as possible. Ideally, I would like it to be possible to implement the exact same API using something like mono embedding API. In simpler terms, I don't want <code>mycorrhiza</code> to be look like some kind of &quot;magic&quot;. I don't want to create another language. I want to use fully standard Rust syntax to express .NET specific concepts. There shouldn't be a <code>Managed</code> or <code>Iron</code> Rust - just Rust compiled for .NET.</p>

<p>This approach is not without its own difficulties. Not all .NET concepts map nicely to Rust, and vice versa. But I believe the benefits of this more moderate approach will outweigh its disadvantages in the end.</p>

<h2 id='hello_world_using_mycorrhiza'>Hello world using <code>mycorrhiza</code></h2>

<p>So, how does interop look like?</p>

<pre><code class="language-Rust">    // Construct a new StringBuilder
    let sb = mycorrhiza::system::text::StringBuilder::empty();
    // Append charcaters which make up the `HelloWorld` string
    sb.append_char('H');
    sb.append_char('e');
    sb.append_char('l');
    sb.append_char('l');
    sb.append_char('o');
    sb.append_char(' ');
    sb.append_char('W');
    sb.append_char('o');
    sb.append_char('r');
    sb.append_char('l');
    sb.append_char('d');
    sb.append_char('!');
    // Get the .NET (managed)String from the StringBuilder
    let mstr = sb.to_mstring();
    // Call Console.WriteLine(mstr)
    mycorrhiza::system::console::Console::writeln_string(mstr);</code></pre>

<p>I would say that it is pretty seamless, while still very much looking like Rust. It is not perfect(function overloading in Rust is a bit tricky), but is already quite close to what my ideal API would look like.</p>

<p>Here is the equivalent C# code for comparison:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">    var sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
    sb.Append('H');
    sb.Append('e');
    // And so on..
    sb.Append('d');
    sb.Append('!');
    var mstring = sb.ToString();
    Console.WriteLine(mstring);</code></pre>

<p>The CIL generated by the codegen is a little bit different, since it also coverts Rusts utf8 chars to .NETs utf16 ones, but this is done in Rust code within mycorrhiza, and not on the compiler side. In the future, you will be able to use rust crates to deal with utf16 directly, but we are still a bit off from that.</p>

<p>This is as good a place to mention it as any, so: the codegen now works with <code>cargo</code>! You can now use Rust crates, and the codegen will link them appropriately. Granted, most of them don't compile yet, but all the linking infrastructure is now there. I now plan on testing and getting more of them running, but this is a task for the future. Because of that, I'd appreciate it if you suggested some simple no-std, no-alloc, no-<code>build.rs</code> crates for testing purposes.</p>

<h2 id='unveiling_the_curtain_a_little_bit'>Unveiling the curtain a little bit</h2>

<p>You are probably wondering how all of this works. How does Rust know about C# types? What you have seen there is a full Rust wrapper around <code>StringBuilder</code>. What if you wanted to use some other type?</p>

<p>I will demonstrate how to write such a wrapper using <code>System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch</code> as an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Rust">// Specify the name of the assembly a class resides in, and then its full path.
pub type Stopwatch = mycorrhiza::intrinsics::RustcCLRInteropManagedClass&lt;&quot;System.Runtime&quot;,&quot;System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch&quot;,&gt;;
impl Stopwatch {
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {
        // New just calls the constuructor with 0 arguments
        Self::ctor0()
    }
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn start(self) {
        // Call instance method with 0 arguments using instance0
        Self::instance0::&lt;&quot;Start&quot;, ()&gt;(self)
    }
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn stop(self) {
        Self::instance0::&lt;&quot;Stop&quot;, ()&gt;(self)
    }
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn reset(self) {
        Self::instance0::&lt;&quot;Reset&quot;, ()&gt;(self)
    }
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn restart(self) {
        Self::instance0::&lt;&quot;Restart&quot;, ()&gt;(self)
    }
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn elapsed_milliseconds(self) -&gt; i64 {
        // Call virtual method `get_ElapsedMilliseconds` to get the value behind the accessor of `ElapsedMilliseconds`.
        Self::virt0::&lt;&quot;get_ElapsedMilliseconds&quot;, i64&gt;(self)
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, specifying a .NET type is almost trivial: we just need to specify which assembly it is in(<code>System.Runtime</code>) and its full path (class name and all namespaces). By creating a type alias, we now can refer to it simply as <code>Stopwatch</code>, preventing potential issues. It is important to get the name of the type right, since .NET can be a bit surprising in that department. Support for generic types is not quite there yet, but it is planned.</p>

<p>For methods, you call them using <code>instance*n*</code>, <code>static*n*</code> and <code>virtaul*n*</code> respectively, where <code>n</code> is the number of arguments a given function takes. You then specify a list of n arguments, followed by the return type - in this case the <code>()</code>, Rust void type. This works similarly for constructors, with the difference of not specifying the return type, and the name being <code>ctor</code>.</p>

<p>Writing wrappers such as this one is important! The codegen has no way to check if a C# type or method exists at compile time, so if you mess this up, you might get a <code>NotFoundException</code> on runtime. This is not ideal, but without having the ability to open assemblies, there is not much more we can do.</p>

<p><code>#[inline(always)]</code> just slightly improves performance and cleans up the generated code.</p>

<p>This is the deepest layer of abstractions almost all people will be dealing with - but there is a bit more to this than what I have shown.</p>

<h2 id='scary_depths'>Scary depths</h2>

<p>One question still remains - how on earth does the compiler know that <code>instance0</code> should be changed to call a managed function? Or that <code>ctor0</code> should be replaced with a <code>newobj</code> instruction? Let's look at the implementation of <code>instance0</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn instance0&lt;const METHOD: &amp;'static str, Ret&gt;(self) -&gt; Ret {
        rustc_clr_interop_managed_call1_::&lt;ASSEMBLY, CLASS_PATH, false, METHOD, false, Ret, Self&gt;(
            self,
        )
    }</code></pre>

<p><code>rustc_clr_interop_managed_call1_</code> and its friends are the key to all of this. This all the magic happens. When the codegen is handling calls, and it sees that a function name contains the phrase <code>rustc_clr_interop_managed_call</code> the codegen recognizes that this function is special - and changes the way it is handled. The definition of <code>rustc_clr_interop_managed_call1_</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn rustc_clr_interop_managed_call1_&lt;const ASSEMBLY: &amp;'static str,const CLASS_PATH: &amp;'static str,const IS_VALUETYPE: bool,const METHOD: &amp;'static str,const IS_STATIC: bool,Ret,Arg1&gt;(arg1: Arg1) -&gt; Ret </code></pre>

<p>The codegen checks the functions' generic arguments (string literals and booleans can be generic arguments in Rust), and uses them to produce a <code>CallSite</code> - internal representation which tells the codegen where to call. And this is really all there is to it - the compiler sees a function with a special name, and replaces it with a call to a managed method.</p>

<p>Almost exactly the same thing happens to <code>ctor0</code> - with the difference being it is converted to a <code>newiobj</code> instruction.</p>

<p>This is the way I plan on implementing some other .NET features (field access, managed array indexing) - with <code>magic</code> functions hidden and abstracted away within <code>mycorrhize</code>.</p>

<h2 id='some_unresolved_questions'>Some unresolved questions</h2>

<p>There are still some iffy things and problems without good solutions. One of them is enforcing some of the constraints of n managed references. Managed references can't be stored on the unmaged heap - it is an UB. This means that in Rust, they should not leave the stack. They can be copied, moved around the stack - but they should not leave this. This concept is not really something easy to model in Rust. Lifetimes only control how long a piece of data lives - not where it exactly is. Pinning enforces something stays in one place - but can't be mixed with Clone and Copy, since those enable you to move the data off the stack. My current solution would be for the codegen to enforce those by preforming checks while compiling - but it is not its job. It can work, but it will be quite clunky. If you have any ideas - let me know.</p>

<p>Another option is to enforce using reference handles - but that has a fair bit of overhead.</p>

<h1 id='first_benchmarks!'>First benchmarks!</h1>

<p>By adding support for basic interop, I managed to get some very rough benchmarks. You should not take them at face value, since my methodology is far from perfect. They were quite consistent, but I did not account for the JIT, optimizing things in longer tests - leading to some bizarre results.</p>

<p>The test was designed to give C# best footing - I only wanted to see how much performance penalty I incur by not optimizing the generated Rust CIL as much as I should. Because of that, those tests don't involve allocating any memory at all, and focus only on speed of raw computations.</p>

<p><code>Codegen Optimzations Disabled</code> means that the Rust code was compiled in release mode, but post-MIR, codegen-internal optimizations were disabled.</p>

<h3 id='fibonacci_of_10,_recursive,_avg_of_10k_runs'>Fibonacci of 10, recursive, Avg of 10K runs</h3>

<p><strong>Rust native (release)</strong>: <em>100 ns        <br /></em></p>

<p><strong>Rust native (debug)</strong>: <em>360 ns        <br /></em></p>

<p><strong>Rust .NET (default optimizations)</strong>: <em>270 ns        <br /></em></p>

<p><strong>Rust .NET (codegen optimizations disabled)</strong>: <em>330 ns        <br /></em></p>

<p><strong>C# release (pure IL)</strong>: <em>250 ns</em></p>

<p><strong>C# debug (pure IL)</strong>: <em>370 ns<br /></em></p>

<p>As you can see, the difference between optimized C# and optimized .NET Rust code is not all that big. It is noticeable(~10%), but I would say it is a pretty good result considering how few optimizations are done right now. The results also show that with optimizations disabled, the generated code is roughly in the same ballpark for all compilation methods. This also shows what the project is not - it does not bring Rust-level raw performance to .NET. I am looking into potentially using the LLVM backend to generate native instructions to then store in a mixed-mode assembly, but that is something I will start seriously working on when the project is mature - at best in a couple of years.</p>

<p>So, let's now look at the &quot;wrong&quot; test results - the ones JIT(?) decided to mess up:</p>

<h3 id='fibonacci_of_10,_recursive,_avg_of_100m_runs'>Fibonacci of 10, recursive, Avg of 100M runs</h3>

<p><strong>Rust native (release)</strong>             : <em>107 ns</em>         <br /></p>

<p><strong>Rust .NET (default optimizations)</strong> : <em>252.3 ns</em>        <br /></p>

<p><strong>C# release (pure IL)</strong>             : <em>281.66 ns</em>    <br /></p>

<p>C# somehow got slower as time went on(IDK how <strong>that</strong> could happen), while .NET Rust got a small boost. This is not my PC throttling - I repeated the tests, switching between C# and Rust, so that they would be run one after the another, back to back. The order did not matter - the results were nothing but consistent. Which is an issue - because while .NET Rust getting faster due to JIT optimizing it better seems reasonable, I would not expect C# to get slower. The simplest explanation is that I messed up the tests. I am using the simplest benchmark method possible (due to interop being not good enough yet) - not the most accurate one.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I believe those results are good enough to carefully guesstimate that the performance of generated Rust code is good enough to not warrant further optimizations just yet.</p>

<h1 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h1>

<p>While we are still a bit off from 0.0.3, I think the project is coming along rather nicely. While the school and a gang of 17th century poets seem to be trying to take as much of my time as possible, I got a bit of help from a couple of contributors, which should hopefully even things out ;).</p>
