My favoirte kind of programing problems are the ones noone needs solved. I also really enjoy Rust and tinkering with compilers. A couple moths ago, I accidentaly stumbled across a pretty unique solution to a very real problem: reflection and metaprograming in Rust. While I am prertty sure this is not the best solution to that problem, I still belive it is a good food for tought, and could serve as inspiration for the final design of reflection in Rust.</p>

<h1 id='reflecting_on_reflcetion'>Reflecting on reflcetion</h1>

<p>The very first question we must ask ourselves is: what is reflection, exactly? If I asked you to describe it in one short sentence, what would it be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reflection is a way to get information <strong>from</strong> the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all reflection is: a way for the compiler to tell us what <strong>it knows</strong> about our program. The rest is nothing more than semantic differences.</p>

<p>Let us now take a short look at something seemingly unrelated: generating code. What do things like proc macros and binding generators do? At their most basic level, they tell the compiler about things <strong>it does not know</strong> about. A binding generator will produce code describing how to use an external library.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Code generation is a way to pass information <strong>to</strong> the compiler</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you notice the symmetry there? We use reflection to get info about types, functions, and statics from the compiler. Code generation is used to do the exact opposite: to tell the compiler about external types and functions, and show it how to use them properly.</p>

<p><em>They are nothing more than an interface between your code and the compiler. The only major difference is the</em> <strong>direction</strong> <em>the data flows.</em></p>

<p>To me, both of them seem like two sides of the same coin. So, what if, for a moment, we started treating them as such?</p>

<p>I propose we try to turn those two monologues, into a conversation between your code and compiler.</p>

<h1 id='metafunctions'>Metafunctions</h1>

<p>Metafunctions are a crosbreed between generics, reflection and code generation. They allow you to programaticaly proivde different implementation of a generic function for each varaint.</p>

<p>A metafunctions consts of 2 distinct, yet interlinked parts. The &quot;target&quot; descirbes the functions signature, but lacks an implemantation.</p>

<p>The implemeantainon is provided at compile time by, well, the &quot;provider&quot;. Take a look:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust ">// The &quot;target&quot; - function which counts the fields of a type, and whose implementation is provided by `field_count_prov`.
#[metafn(provider = field_count_prov)]
unsafe fn field_count&lt;T&gt;()-&gt;usize;

// The &quot;provider&quot; - a const function invoked by the compiler, which returns the implementation
// of `field_count`.
const fn field_count_prov(ctx:MetaFnCtx)-&gt;Result&lt;MIRBody,MetaFnError&gt;{
    // ...
}</code></pre>

<p>The keen eyed amoung you might have already noticed a couple of things. Let me explain how this works, step-by-step.</p>

<p>The function <code>field_count</code> is marked with a very special attribute - <code>#[metafn]</code>. This attribute tells the compiler the implemenation of this function will be generated proceduraly by <code>field_count_prov</code>.</p>

<p><code>field_count_prov</code> is a const function - it needs to be called at compile-time,  after all. It takes in one argument, of type <code>MetaFnCtx</code>. This name stands for <code>Meta Function Context</code>. Such a context contains information about which generic variant of <code>field_count</code> is needed. So, for example, the exact type <code>T</code> is will be contained there.</p>

<p>The context also contains references to internal compiler data structures - this is what will enable us to query the compiler for more details.</p>

<p>The provider function returns a <code>Result&lt;MIRBody,MetaFnError&gt;</code>. So, if everyting goes well, it will return MIR implementing the target function. MIR is the repersentation of a Rust program used internaly, by the compiler. This may seem strange at first - after all, we don't want to expose any unstable APIs!</p>

<p>Chosing MIR is very deliberate - while not stable yet, it will be, one day. The stable MIR project aims to expose stable APIs for interacting with the compiler - we can just reuse that work here. MIR is also the represenation used by the Rust compiler during the morphization stage - the point at which the copiler turns generic functions into many specialzed(concreate) ones.</p>

<p>Since <code>field_count_prov</code> will be called at that point, it will be able to provide specialzed implemenation for each <code>T</code>!</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Vec3(f32,f32,f32);
struct Vec2(f32,f32);
fn main(){
    unsafe{
        assert_eq!(field_count::&lt;Vec3&gt;(),3);
        assert_eq!(field_count::&lt;Vec2&gt;(),2);
        // Works for external types too!
        assert_eq!(field_count::&lt;String&gt;(),3);
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>You might have noticed that <code>field_count</code> is unsafe - but why?</p>

<p>MIR itself is very unsafe. Since it is ususaly created after all the safety checks, the compiler does not need to check it the second time. We &quot;bypass&quot; those checks by creating MIR directly - so the compiler can't guarantee this function is safe.</p>

<p>I haven't looked into how hard it would be to check MIR for safety - so for now, I want to be extra carefull and assume it is impossible. Because of that, all generated code is assumed to be unsafe.</p>

<p>Now that I explained the concept, let me show you how you would use it.</p>

<h2 id='proceduraly_implementing_field_count'>Proceduraly implementing <code>field_count</code></h2>

<p>The very first step we need to take is to get the 1 generic argument of <code>field_count</code>(our <code>T</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">    let t = ctx.gargs()[0];</code></pre>

<p>Here, we take it from the generic argument array. But what happens if we accidentaly tried to index out of bounds of the <code>gargs</code> array?</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">// The `std` will proivde certain APIs for dealing with MIR. `std::metafunctions` is a placeholder and may be changed.
use std::metafunctions::{MetaFnCtx,MIRBody,MetaFnError,ADTKind,TerminatorKind,const_scalar};
// The &quot;target&quot; - function which whose implementation is provided by `field_count_prov`
#[metafunction(provider = field_count_prov)]
unsafe fn field_count&lt;T&gt;()-&gt;usize;
// The &quot;provider&quot; - a const function invoked by the compiler, which returns the implementation
// of `field_count`.
const fn field_count_prov(ctx:MetaFnCtx)-&gt;Result&lt;MIRBody,MetaFnError&gt;{
    // We check that the generic arg number 0 is a type, and is an ADT(struct,enum or union).
    let adt = ctx.gargs()[0].as_ty()?.as_adt()?;
    // Panics are reported as errors(MetaFnError::ImplBug) by the compiler 
    if adt.kind() != AdtKind::Struct{
        todo!(&quot;Can't yet count the fields of types that are not structs!&quot;);
    }
    // We count the number of fields
    let field_count = atd.fields().count();
    // The MIR builder does not need to be mutable, since multiple blocks can be created at the same time.
    let builder = ctx.mir_builder();
    // Creates a new MIR basic block
    let mut bb0 = builder.next_bb();
    // We assign a constant value of type `usize` to the returned local(_0)
    bb0.assign_statement(ctx.return_place(),const_scalar::&lt;usize&gt;(field_count));
    // Every block ends with a terminator - in this case, it ends with a return 
    bb0.terminate(TerminatorKind::Return);
    // A call to `finalize` validates the MIR and turns a `MIRBuilder` into `MIRBody`
    builder.finalize()
}</code></pre>
