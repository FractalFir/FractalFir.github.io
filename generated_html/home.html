That is the question many of us ask themselves, waken in the middle of the night. Thanlfully, in this case, the answere is straightforward! I am a relarively young and not very experienced programmer from the wonderfull european country of Poland. I often create projects with doubious usefulness, but a lot of interesting things to learn from. I treat programming a little bit like art: I don&#8217;t belive everything needs to be usefull. So, hop right in, and join me on my whacky adventures, as I try to solve the all the problems <strong>I</strong> created!</p>
