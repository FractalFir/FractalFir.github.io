The question that fascinates me the most about computers is <code>Could I?</code>, when I should propably ask myself <code>Should I?</code> a little bit more. This is reflected in my projects, which often find new and innovative way to solve problems none has. But programing is sometimes a little bit like art, it is not the destination that is important. What is often key is what we learn and discover along the way.</p>

<p>So, sit tight, and join me on my adventures, as we find whacky ways to do things, we propably would be better off not doing!</p>
