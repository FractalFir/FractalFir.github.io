<p>Well, this is a slight oversimplification. I am currently working on <a href='https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr'>`rustc_codegen_clr`</a> - a Rust compiler backend, targeting .NET. It basically enables the Rust compiler to produce .NET assemblies from Rust code. Ok, nice, but what does this have to do with the topic of this article?</p>

<p>Well, my compiler is not exactly bug free. For the past few weeks, I have been playing whack-a-mole with bugs, and sadly, I think I am loosing.</p>

<p>Turns out, testing a brand-new compiler backend is not a trivial task.</p>

<p>First of all, you can't trust anything to be right. Even something as simple as arthritics must be extensively tested - because it can be broken.</p>

<p>Second of all - most test programs are not as simple as they look. Even the simplest Rust test:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">#[test]
fn simple(){
    // How complicated can this be?
}</code></pre>

<p>requires a lot of stuff to work flawlesly to even start running. Argument parsing, unwinding, allocations, String formating - the list could go on for ages.</p>

<p>This means that the test suite used by your &quot;standard&quot; Rust compiler is of no use here. Because of that, I have been writing my own, custom test programs.</p>

<p>Recently, I have asked myself an unusal question:</p>

<p><em>What is the simplest way to</em><em>prove</em><em>a Rust compiler is working correctly?</em></p>

<h1 id='proff_start'>Proff start</h1>

<h2 id='what_do_i_want?'>What do I want?</h2>

<p>Before searching for such a proof, we must first know what are we looking for.</p>

<p>First of all, this &quot;proof&quot; is meant for simple, WIP projects. Our tests <strong>must</strong> be stupidly simple, and depend on almost nothing.<br /></p>

<p>Second of all, the &quot;proof&quot; should relay on minimal assumptions. Sadly, we must assume some things about the compiler we test are true. The set of initial assumptions I went with is pretty small(3 assumptions), so this should not be an issue.</p>

<p>The assumptiuons should be also easy to fuliffl and check.</p>

<p>Our proof will relly on some tests that we will perform.</p>

<p>A test can have 3 possible results: Pass, Fail, and Unknown. A test has an  Unknown state</p>
